        <h2 id="about">About me</h2>
        <p>I like to do things with computers since 2001. Born in Brazil and currently living in Lisbon, Portugal, I now work as a Software Engineer at Farfetch.</p>
        <p>Back then, I have started by opening (and breaking) computers, creating simple PHP and MySQL websites, playing with Linux distros, and learning algorithms with C, in the end, I happened to be where I am now.</p>
        <p>Challenges are what moves me. I have faced a lot, like leading the development of a mobile social game for a big banking institution, creating entire web applications from scratch, and introducing new technologies to replace old ones.</p>
        <p>Being passionate about software development, I will never be done with learning, so I try my best to keep up with the newest technologies and hope to become a Software Architect in the future.</p>
